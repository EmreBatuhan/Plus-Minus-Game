    <h1>HOW TO PLAY</h1>
    <p>Plus-minus is a two-player game. The goal is to find the opponent's number before they find yours.
    Firstly both of the players choose a 4-digit number with distinct digits. Then one of the players starts by making a guess of the opponent's number.
    After the guess,the opponent tells how close the guess was by using +a -b notation. For every digit that is in both guess number and secret number, we do the following:<br>
    If the digit is at the same place for both guess number and secret number, then we add 1 to plus.<br>
    If the digit is not at the same place for both guess number and secret number, then we add 1 to minus.<br>
    <p>After we calculate "+a -b" -for example "+2 -1"- ,we do not tell the result of a-b. We simply say "plus two minus one".
    After that the guess and the result are told , then other player proceeds with his turn.
    When one player's guess matches the opponent's secret number -which means "+4 -0"- the player that made the guess wins the game.<br>
    <p>The computer does all calculations on guess results. Computer does know your secret number but no worries ! Computer never cheats.
    Computer does not use your secret number for its guess. You can safely give your secret number at the beginning of the game.</p>
    <h2>Example </h2>
    <p>Let's assume Secret Number = 1234 and guess number = 1253 <br>
    Since 1 and 2 are included in both of the numbers and their positions are the same, they mean +2.<br>
    3 is also included in both of the numbers but its position has changed so it means -1.
    So the result is "+2 -1".</p>
